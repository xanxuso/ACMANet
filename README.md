# ACMANet

This project provides the codes and results for 'Asymmetric Cross-Modal Activation Network for RGB-T Salient Object Detection'.

## Saliency Map Results
1. VT5000, VT1000, VT821
   
   Saliency maps obtained by training 2500 sample pairs from the VT5000. [RGB_T Saliency Map](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1cTTEA9IDJOG9OQI5abToJA) (1p88)

2. RGB_D SOD datasets
   
   training and testing data can be downloaded from [RGB_D datasets](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1JEIZzYCJLkr1m1fde9hfXg) (sewq)
